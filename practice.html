    The <b>Chicken</b>

    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">chicken</a> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species
        that arose from the red junglefowl,
        originally from
        India.
        They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
        junglefowl, and
        green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
        cockerel. A
        male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is
        called
        a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.
        Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
        domesticated for
        meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>

    <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of
        2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There
        are
        numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.
    </p>

    <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia,[3]
        but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent. From
        ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th
        century BC,
        with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
        according to
        the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century BC.[7][8]</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.</p>

    <h3>Biology and habitat</h3>
    <p>Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even
        animals
        as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or sometimes young mice.[28]</p>

    <p>The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known chicken lived
        for 16
        years, according to Guinness World Records.[30]</p>

    <p>Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long, flowing tails and shiny,
        pointed
        feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those
        of
        females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly
        pointed
        neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. Identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually by
        the
        development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may
        be
        differentiated by colour).</p>

    <p>Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on
        either side
        under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are
        called
        caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds, these are more prominent
        in males.
        A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds that causes extra feathering under the
        chicken's face,
        giving the appearance of a beard.[31]</p>

    <p>Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of
        flying for
        short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally
        fly
        briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.</p>

    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
    <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
        eggs and
        raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking order, with
        dominant
        individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes
        a
        temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially
        younger
        birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[citation needed]</p>

    <p>Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator. At least one credible report exists of a
        young
        fox killed by hens.[32][33][34] If a chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, it may puff up its
        feathers.[35]</p>
